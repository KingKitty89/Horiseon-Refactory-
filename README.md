## **Description**

For this project I was given a HTML file and a CSS file. I was asked to create a more accesible website and to clean up the code in each file. I added alt tags to each of the images, changed font sizes and colors so they would stand out more on the page, added a hover attribute to the navagation links so they would be more apparent, made sure the images were resized to help with loading times, and consolidated the CSS to make it more streamlined.
